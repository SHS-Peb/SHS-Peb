# Hi, I’m Shannon 👋

I’m a Sydney-based full stack developer with a passion for building clean, purposeful tech that makes life a little easier, a little neater, and a lot more connected.

### 💡 Always Learning, Always Building
After completing the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp with the University of Sydney, I’ve kept the momentum going — tackling personal projects, attending industry events and constantly learning new tools and frameworks.

I document much of that journey on my [blog](https://tech-talk-in-pink.blogspot.com), where I break down complex tech concepts in a human-friendly way.
